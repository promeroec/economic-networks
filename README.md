# Economic Networks Model - Implementation Complete

## Overview

This is a complete Python implementation of the agent-based computational model described in:

**"The Evolution of Economic Networks"** by Pedro P. Romero (2009)

The implementation faithfully reproduces the model's mechanisms and successfully replicates the paper's key findings.
